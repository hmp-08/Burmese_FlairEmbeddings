# Burmese_FlairEmbeddings

## Overview
This repository contains a FlairEmbeddings model trained for the Burmese language. FlairEmbeddings is a powerful library for state-of-the-art natural language processing in Python. This model has been trained to capture contextualized word representations for Burmese text.

## Features
Pre-trained FlairEmbeddings model for Burmese.

Easy integration with Flair library.

Supports various downstream NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
Flair library installed (pip install flair)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hmp-08/Burmese_FlairEmbeddings.git
cd burmese-FlairEmbeddings
```

### Usage
1. Load the pre-trained Burmese FlairEmbeddings model:
```
from flair.embeddings import FlairEmbeddings

# specify the path to your pre-trained model
model_path = "path/to/burmese-flair-embeddings"

# load the embeddings
burmese_embeddings = FlairEmbeddings(model_path)
```
2.Use the embeddings in NLP tasks:
```
from flair.data import Sentence

# create a sentence
sentence = Sentence("Burmese text goes here.")

# embed the sentence
burmese_embeddings.embed(sentence)

for token in sentence:
    print(token)
    print(token.embedding)
```
